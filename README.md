Providing information about MORSE CODE
What is a Morse Code? : a Morse code is a communication language that represents the alphabets and numbers through the use of dots and dashes.(https://study.com)
Why morse code was created (historical context)? : It was created by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail to facilitate communication through the newly invented electric graph. The need for a simple and efficient way to send coded messages along telegraph wires led to the development of the system, which uses a combination of dots and dashes to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation (https://www.englishclub.com)
A morse code uses a system of short and long beeps, or pulses, to represent letters, punctuation and numbers. Short beeps are called dots(.), and long beeps are called dashes(-)like letter "A" it is "(.-)" in morse code. Each letter of the alphabet has a unique combination of dots and dashes, again like letter "C" (" -.-."). https://www.learningmorsecode.com
Dots and dashes: dots represent short pulse and dashes represents a longer pulsea typically three times the duration of a dot 
Spacing: A space between dots and dashes within a letter is one unit (the durationof a dot)
       : The space between letters is three units (the duration of the 3 dots)
       : The space between words is seven units (the duration of the 7 dots)
Example with the word "HEY" in morse code it is written 
H: .....
E: .
Y: -.--
H: ....
O: ---
P: .--.
E: . 
in combination it is written this way: .... . -.--       .... --- .--. .
